### ❖ Overview

This project is is part of the Fetch.ai hackathon submission at NIT Goa. We were given a Hugging Face model - [*t5-base-finetuned-emotion*](https://huggingface.co/mrm8488/t5-base-finetuned-emotion) (text-to-text model) to use the model to detect emotions in conversations.

### 🏆 Our Goal

We aimed to make use of the given Hugging Face Model for Emotion Recognition combined with Gemini API to build a mental health therapy platform. This platform is powered by two micro-agents implemented using the the uagents library.

### 📋 Features

- **USER'S Mental Health Assessment :** We are analysing our user's mental health dynamically while he/she is chatting with our AI Agent. After a conversation we give a detailed mental health assessment report to the user based on the detected emotions and problems.

- **Mental Health Therapist Reccomendation :** If the user's assessment report shows signs of depression, anxiety or any other mental health issues that are SEVERE then we reccomend top 5 mental health therapists based on user's location.

- **Mental Health Resources :** We provide a list of mental health resources like helplines, websites,videos and support groups to the user based on their location for users having MILD symptoms. 

- **Dedicated WhatsApp Bot :** We have also built the same AI Chatbot on WhatsApp platform using the WhatApp Cloud APIs and Custom Webhooks. So users can also chat with our AI therapist on WhatsApp for 24/7 support.
